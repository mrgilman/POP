    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>This project came about after listening to a lot of people's frustrations with the Government. Generally, these frustrations were from people who:
      <ul>
        <li>Were upset with what the Government was doing; or</li>
        <li>Just wanted the Government to change slightly to make their lives a bit better</li>
      </ul>
    <p>So that's why this project was created: To have people provide solutions to the things that bother or affect them.</p>
